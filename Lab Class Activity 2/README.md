# Lab Class Activity 2 Repo



Final Class Activity Bonus Marks



For this project we have been tasked with enhancing the visuals of the provided Contra level by adding shaders from the first and second half of our semester. 



For our solution, we recreated the scene in Unity, using primitive objects for the gameplay space and sprites for the background. Through this approach we were able to quickly create a mock up of the 2D scene in 3D and get to implementing shaders.



The shaders we implemented are as follows:



Wave displacement shader used to simulate the water in our scene

Metallic shader applied to any metallic surfaces in the scene

Transparency shader applied to the background of our trees

Scrolling texture used to simulate the waterfall

We have utilized a rim lighting shader to enhance the look of the explosion happening in scene.

We also utilized color correction to give the explosion a distinct glow.



We utilized these specific shaders because we felt they best fit with the objects in the scene and work well together to create an improved graphical experience for Contra in 3D.
